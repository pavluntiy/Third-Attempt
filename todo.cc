todo:

def operator+(int, int) // it should report by exception, not by SEGFAULT
10 + 20

def int rand()
def float(int)
def magic(float) // like this

Data still misbehaves with one-line comments at the end of file.

Add possibility to declare type synonims in structures

using int Int
using Int INt
using INt INT
//Excessive instance of basic type appears in map<>

using def fType fType();

toString() const!

sizeof
some shit with types!
